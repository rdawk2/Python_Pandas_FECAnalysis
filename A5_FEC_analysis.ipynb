    "http://classic.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml files for download and the metadata.\n",

    "Refer to examples in the Notebook I used in class as needed for starting points.  It is here: https://github.com/iSchool-590PR-2018Spring/in-class-examples/blob/master/week_7_FEC_pandas.ipynb\n",

    "# Instructions:\n",
    "* As with previous assignments, first create a Fork of this repository, and immediately remove the \"Participants\" team from having access to yours. \n",
    "* Do not copy the whole lecture notebook into this one, because a lot of it does not pertain directly to the analysis in the assignment. But you may copy relevant segments from it to get started.\n",
    "* **Choose and implement 4 of the analytical queries from the lists below. At least one must be from the \"multi-file\" list.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add the code necessary to complete each one using Pandas DataFrames and/or Pandas Series. Clearly label each one with \"Markdown\" cells above them, and reasonable amounts of documentation between any intermediate results to show how you created the result. \n",
    "* Once you have things working, delete any wrong or experimental code that you may still have lingering, so that what remains shows just the complete start-to-finish process of loading the data and producing your analytical results.\n",
    "* Save the notebook _with your outputs shown_.\n",
    "* Commit & Push this notebook file before the due date so we can see your work in GitHub for grading & feedback."

    "# QUERIES TO CHOOSE FROM:\n",
    "\n",
    "[General tips: Unless stated otherwise, you may use just a single 2-year data set to compute any of these. Nearly every query below will need the groupby() method. Any time a query description has 'per' or 'each', that means you need to use groupby on the column(s) that follow.]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Single-file queries:\n",
    "* List the top 30 professions (Occupations) for total donations.  This is an easy one to get started with.\n",
    "\n",
    "* List the top 15 cities by total individual donations. Try creating a visual barchart with matplotlib -- it's not  hard. See examples from Week 6 or the McKinney book.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compute the total amount of donations received PER MONTH from all individuals together, listing in date order. [Tips: You'll have to correct the import parsing of TRANSACTION_DT in the itcont.txt file -- The original text files have dates like '13102017' for Oct. 13, 2017. ]\n",
    "\n",
    "* List all individuals who donated a TOTAL of over $100,000 dollars. First clean up the data a bit by removing prefixes like \"Mr.\", \"Mrs.\", \"Ms.\" and \"Dr.\" from the names.  This will help the same people's donations get grouped together properly. Show name, city, state, employer, occupation, and total amount. [Tips: You must groupby name+city+state or by name+zipcode.  Also, you DO NOT need to merge or join the grouped result back to the original dataframe to make this work.  Instead, consult documentation on using the agg() method with a dictionary to indicate which function or operation should be applied to which column in the grouped result.]\n",
    "\n",
    "* For donations directly to the presidential election only (from 2015-2016 files), determine total individual donations PER STATE.  Do not include the Senate and House candidates' fund raising.\n"

For each one, list the name of every Corporation or other PAC (i.e. non-individuals) that has \"bought\" them with huge donations (let's say over $50,000 dollars each). [\"Incumbent\" means they're already in office and are running for re-election. This is in the \"CAND_ICI\" column.]\n",

    "* Find the donating moderates: Find out how many and what percentage of individual donors have contributed to BOTH  Democratic and Republican candidates in the same election cycle (same 2-year file set).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find individual people who donated over $2000 directly to a Senate or House candidate who's not even in their own state, and show the details (names & states of both people). [Tip: You'll need to compare the candidate's state to the individual donor's state after you get them joined.]\n",

This is the ONLY query where the  concat() method should be used, to combine multiple years' data into a single DataFrame covering that whole range from 2013-2018. Then use that to compute an analysis of this:  Political activity is much higher for Presidential elections than in other years. Find out whether the level of donations to Senate and House campaigns goes up or down at that time compared to other years.\n",

Also, you DO NOT need to merge or join the grouped result back to the original dataframe to make this work. Instead, consult documentation on using the agg() method with a dictionary to indicate which function or operation should be applied to which column in the grouped result.]"
